        <p>We are group 13. Members are Paul Christian Mocanu, Faisal Ibadina, Maxime de Rolland-Dalon, Elliot Hermans :)</p>
        <p>You might have seen other versions of 2048 on the internet and got tired of seeing the same default colours and layout. With this in mind, we removed everything unnecessary to the game and focused on the functionality. This gives the game a nostalgic vibe to the very first game released by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. So instead of looking for the next clone of 2048, why not try our version. Come and gain the experience that the very first players had when being introduced to 2048!</p>
