                        What started as a mandatory project given to us by the university quickly turned into an
                        enjoyable experience for the group as we figured out how,
                        when and why things work the way they do, and as such, we are proud to present to you our game:
                        2048.

                    <p>The game 2048 is a simple game with intuitive mechanics.
                        You start off with a 4x4 grid of square out of which 2 squares have a value of 2 or 4.
                        <br><br>
                        Whenever the player makes a move, two of the empty squares get a random value of 2 or 4. The goal of the game is to get a square to the value of 2048, just like the name implies.
                        To do that, you need to add up adjacent squares with the same value, all the while making sure to not fill the board as this will make you lose the game.
                        <br><br>
                        The difficulty of the game should not be underestimated. For example, none of us managed to win the game during these 6 weeks.
                        We took inspiration from the site
