                        While this method is self-explanatory, its developments had a lot of problems we had to fix and
                        refactor.
                        It went from a simple method that counted the number of filled squares to a hard-coded method
                        that checked adjacent squares for similar values to a dynamic method which checks adjacent
                        squares while making sure to not go out of bounds.

                        This method is utilising a very efficient way of returning values as it doesn’t even have to
                        reach the end of the method to return the desired Boolean.

                        two of the empty squares will get a random value of 2 or 4.

                    <p>As some of us remember the good ol’ days of saveless games, the frustration was hard when you had to finish a game in one siting. Thus, we decided to show the load game method which calls on the database to give us the state of a game which has been saved previously. </p>

                        It implements a highly efficient manner of extracting the values from the result set by combining the functionality of a while loop and a for loop. At the end, the method returns the array of squares which will be utilised by the screen class to display it accordingly.
